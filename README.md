# applied-robotics-f2024 Final Project

## Gripper Position
Opening: 0.0
Closing: 0.625

## Targets Positions 
Top of the cube: [ 0.46, -0.1, 0.5 ]
Position of the cube: [ 0.46, -0.1, 0.46 ] 
Lift the cube: [ 0.46, -0.1, 0.6 ] 
Top of the cup: [ 0.45, 0.1, 0.6 ]

The orientation is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] for all the positions.

## Result
1. Moves on top of the cube
2. Opens the claw
3. Moves down to the cube
4. Closes the claw
5. Picks it up
6. Moves down to replace the cube (to avoid the cube falling)
7. Lifts the cube
8. Moves to the top of the cup
9. Drops it in the cup

The robots can put the cube in the cup 95% of the time.
